# HarvardX CS50x

**I stopped taking CS50x for lack of time / interest - I might return to it in the future. While it's nice to glimpse into Harvard, I don't see any value in solving entry-level problems in my free time. I'm not learning anything new.**

This repo holds all of the exercises I had to do four CS50x (Introduction to Computer Science) from HarvardX (the Harvard branch of edX). You can learn more about CS50 [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu).

#### A note on the horrendously ugly styling of this code
All code styling follows this style guide: https://manual.cs50.net/style/. Personally, my eyes begin to bleed while looking at code formatted this way, but a styleguide is styleguide - and I'm following it.
